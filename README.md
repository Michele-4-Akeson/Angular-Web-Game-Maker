### **Purpose/Use:**
The Hippo Game Engine is designed to help users design really simple 2D games (either top-down or side-view) which can be run efficiently in the browser, due to several system optimizations. The Hippo Game Engine uses several **OOP design patterns**, specifcally the Decorator, and Observer patterns, allowing for more robust code that is flexible and easily extendable.
- Users can create an account
- Create personal games, save them to edit later, and share those games publicly with other users of the Hippo Engine



#### **NOTE:**
This is the provided public repo for the Angular Web Game Maker (informally known by many as "Hippo Engine", "Pain Main", "Big Water Rino - the Game Editor", and so on...). It's a fun little passion project that I hope you get the chance to mess aorund with!  


### **TO DO:**
1. Create more features/abilities that can be added to game entities
