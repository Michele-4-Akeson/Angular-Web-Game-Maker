### **Purpose/Use:**
This Game Maker is designed to help users design simple 2D games (either top-down or side-view) which can be run efficiently in the browser, due to several system optimizations. The Hippo Engine Game Maker uses several **OOP design patterns**, specifcally the Decorator, and Observer patterns, allowing more robust code that is flexible and easily extendable



#### **NOTE:**
This is the provided public repo for the Angular Web Game Maker (informally known by many as "Hippo Engine", "Pain Main", "Big Water Rino - the Game Editor", and so on...). It's a fun little passion project that hope you get the chance to mess aorund with!  


### **TO DO:**
1. Create more features/abilities that can be added to game entities
2. Update child gameObject collision detection
