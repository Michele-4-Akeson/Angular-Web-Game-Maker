### **Purpose/Use:**
This Game Maker is designed to help users design simple 2D games (either top-down or side-view) which can be run efficiently in the browser, due to several system optimizations. The Hippo Engine Game Maker uses several **OOP design patterns**, specifcally the Decorator, and Observer patterns, allowing more robust code that is flexible and easily extendable

This is the provided public repo for the Angular Web Game Maker (informally known by many as "Hippo Engine", "Pain Main", "Big Water Rino - the Game Editor", and so on...). It's a fun little passion project that hope you get the chance to mess aorund with!  


### **TO DO:**
1. Create more features/abilities that can be added to game entities
2. Update child gameObject collision detection
